# Eurecom-AML

## Description
Gatherings of my work for EURECOM's **[Algorithmic Machine Learning Course](http://www.eurecom.fr/en/course/AML-2018Spring)** with Prof P.Michiardi.
The following Notebooks used the PySpark API on a cluster of computers managed by **[Zoe](https://github.com/DistributedSystemsGroup/zoe)**.

This course covers :
1. Data cleaning
2. Dala analysis
3. Algorithm implementation/selection
4. Algorithm evaluation and validation
5. Optimization and further research
